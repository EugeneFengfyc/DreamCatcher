# DreamCatcher
Android DreamCatcher
the DreamCatcher app will allow a user to document their dreams. Dreams in this system are just aspirations,  
achievements, or any other goals the user might have. Each dream is tracked along with sequence of intermediate reflections,     
which can be used to record short notes or to indicate partial progress toward the goal.  
A dream may be marked as deferred, meaning it's not currently actively pursued, or may be marked as fulfilled,
  meaning that the goal has been reached.
